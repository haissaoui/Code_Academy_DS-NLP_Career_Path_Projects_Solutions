# Codecademy Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Career Path Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the projects in the Codecademy Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Career Path course. Specifically, it includes notebooks for the following projects:

* Frida Kahlo Cumulative Project: This project is part of the Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part I) module. It involves analyzing a dataset of Frida Kahlo's artwork and answering questions using Python's basic data structures, such as lists and loops.

* Coded Correspondence Project: This project is part of the Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II) module. It involves decoding a message using string manipulation techniques in Python.

* Medical Insurance Project: This project is part of the Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II) module. It involves analyzing a dataset of medical insurance claims and answering questions using Python's dictionary data structure.

All projects were completed using Jupyter notebooks and Python 3. They are well-documented and contain detailed explanations of the thought process and methodology behind each solution.

Feel free to browse the notebooks and explore the code. If you have any feedback or questions, don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting!
